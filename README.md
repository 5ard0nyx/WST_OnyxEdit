# WeaponSwingTimerAddon
WeaponSwingTimer is an addon for WoW Classic that tracks your's and your target's swing timer. It resets on abilities that would reset a swing timer, such as Warrior's Slam, and also takes parry haste into account. The frame can be moved around with the typical click-and-drag. A configuration window can be brought up with /wst /WeaponSwingTimer or /weaponswingtimer where more visual options are available.
