NOTES FROM STRESS TEST
* Everything seemed really large
* Changable font size would be nice
* Changable fonts would also be nice
* Profiles would also be nice
* Snapping to center when click and drag would also be nice
* Multiple textures would also be nice
* Need to fixup the config menu
* Spark needs to be brighter in the middle and less bright everywhere else, the size is fine
* Blue bar is a little washed out
	0.1, 0.1, 0.9 RGB is better
* Red bar is also a little washed out
	0.8, 0.1, 0.1 RGb is better
* Get rid of global settings
* Hunter bar needs some latency marker for the 0.5 "cast time" of autoshot
* Make YaHT multishot bar two markers like it is with the onebar setting
* Add text to the hunter bar
* Remove unstable notes from hunter cast bar options description
* Make YaHT not the default
* Make the Multishot marker not on by default (Popup window when hunter turns 18 to enable it if they want to)
* Make the multishot marker opacity full by default
* Figure out why the colors are white instead of their colors (Something with some setting wanting opacity while others want transparency)
* Landing page of the addon acts like a tutorial
* Add something so the addon adds a button that attaches to the minimap
* Hunter bar colors are a bit in your face
* Bug with first attack not doing inital cast time when attack is toggled on for hunter shot
* The borders are really large, make them smaller
	- Change border edge size to 12, change backdrop points to 9 instead of 12
