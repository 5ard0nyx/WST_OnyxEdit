BUGS
* The settings interface looks like shit.
* Spellcasts should reset the swing timer apparently? Need to test this with a mage or something.
* Toggling the hunter bar enable while shooting causes the timer to be incorrect until autoshot is toggled on and off.
* Toggling the melee bar enables while swinging causes the timer to be incorrect until a hit lands.
* Untested Multishot.
* Untested Hunter cast delay.
* Hunter bar takes roughly 3 seconds to load when the interface is reloaded.
