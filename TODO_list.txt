BUGS
* Hunter bar takes roughly 3 seconds to load when the interface is reloaded
* Speed buffs should only affect the next swing
* Bug with first attack not doing initial cast time when attack is toggled on for hunter shot

TODO FROM STRESS TEST
* Changable font size would be nice
* Changable fonts would also be nice
* Dragging and dropping to any point other than CENTER causes the offsets in the settings to be off
	I need to make a utility that converts other points to CENTER
* Snapping to center when click and drag would also be nice

* Need to fixup the config menu
* Spark needs to be brighter in the middle and less bright everywhere else, the size is fine
* Get rid of global settings
* Hunter bar needs some latency marker for the 0.5 "cast time" of autoshot
* Make YaHT multishot bar two markers like it is with the onebar setting
* Make the Multishot marker not on by default (Popup window when hunter turns 18 to enable it if they want to)
* Make the multishot marker opacity full by default
* Figure out why the colors are white instead of their colors (Something with some setting wanting opacity while others want transparency)
* Landing page of the addon acts like a tutorial

* The hunter auto shot cast time seems to be inconsistant. 
	There is a a 0.15s swing between the full autoshot cooldown and cast, and a 0.7 swing between the cast time. 
	The cast time was between 0.53s and 0.63s with a 2.3s bow with a rnage speed of 2.091
	The whole shot time was between 2.051 and 2.187 while standing still with a range speed of 2.091
* Hunter cast time seems to be increased if the cast time has been cliped significantly 
	(like a full 0.5s clip causes the shot cast time to be roughly 1.0-0.9 secs)
* Hunter instant shots cast during the "cast time" of an auto shot is resetting the bar when it shouldn't
	This was fixed by checking the cast time, for some reason the cast time of instant cast shots is like -100000

THINGS ACE3 WOULD MAKE EASIER
* Profiles would also be nice
* Add something so the addon adds a button that attaches to the minimap
* Multiple textures would also be nice
